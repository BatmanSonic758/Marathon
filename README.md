# Sonic '06 Toolkit
Sonic '06 Toolkit is an application originally written in VB.NET to help make modding easier for SONIC THE HEDGEHOG (2006). Now being written in C#, Sonic '06 Toolkit has been made open-source to allow the community to contribute to the project.

# Project Goals
### ARC Unpacking and Repacking (to be replaced)
- Currently based off [Shadow LAG](https://github.com/lllsondowlll) and [ModdingUnderground](https://www.youtube.com/user/ModdingUnderground)'s ARC unpacker/repacker. Once [RadfordHound](https://github.com/Radfordhound)'s [HedgeLib](https://github.com/Radfordhound/HedgeLib) ARC class is complete, we will be able to make use of that.

### LUB Decompiling (to be replaced)
- Currently based off [Shadow LAG](https://github.com/lllsondowlll)'s Java-based Lua decompiler which is soon to be replaced.

### XNO Converting and XNM Pairing (done)
- Currently based off [Skyth](https://github.com/blueskythlikesclouds) and [DarioSamo](https://github.com/DarioSamo)'s [XNO converter](https://github.com/blueskythlikesclouds/SkythTools/blob/master/Sonic%20'06/xno2dae.exe).

### CSB Extracting and ADX Encoding (done)
- Currently based off [Skyth](https://github.com/blueskythlikesclouds)'s [Sonic Audio Tools](https://github.com/blueskythlikesclouds/SonicAudioTools) for extracting CSB files and some tools from [CRI Middleware Corporation](https://www.criware.com/en/) for encoding ADX files.

### MST Decoding
- Planned features to decode MST files, which are BINA string tables with null terminated unicode.
