Sure! Use Git to clone the repository to your drive and use [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) to compile it (this project was developed and built with Visual Studio 2019).

### "Are there any pre-requisites that are required?"
Yes, see the [Requirements](https://github.com/HyperPolygon64/Sonic-06-Toolkit#requirements) section at the bottom of this document.

### "How do I mod this game, then?"
Refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/HyperPolygon64/Sonic-06-Toolkit/wiki) for more in-depth information.
