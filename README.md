# Sonic '06 Toolkit
The all-in-one toolkit for SONIC THE HEDGEHOG (2006) modding!

Sonic '06 Toolkit is an application originally written in VB.NET to help make modding easier for SONIC THE HEDGEHOG (2006). Now being written in C#, Sonic '06 Toolkit has been made open-source to allow the community to contribute to the project.

# Project Goals
Because this is a complete rewrite, the goal is to include everything that was in the VB.NET version so users aren't missing out on the original features.

### ARC Unpacking and Repacking
- Yes, the key features to at least modify the contents of the archives.

### LUB Decompiling
- There are currently no plans to re-use the same technique used in the VB.NET version to decompile Lua binaries. It would be easier to write a Lua decompiler than depend on Java as a requirement.

### XNO Converting and XNM Pairing
- Likely using the same method as last time to convert these files, but improving XNM pairing as it can be rather tedious.

### ADX Encoding (new)
- Planned features to add tools for encoding and decoding ADX files for sound modding.

### MST Decoding (new)
- Planned features to decode MST files, which are BINA string tables with null terminated unicode.
